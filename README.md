"Explore It" is Word search app which can be used for searching relevant results from different sources about a particular word.

(1) Using Longaman's dictionary API, displays the meaning of the word along with a pronounciation of the word if available.

(2) Using the wikipedia API, displays the first few paragraphs of the given word with a direct link to the actual article.

(3) Using Youtube API, Gives relevant results about the word usually 8 also a in built pop up player is embedded which can 
play the videos with actually going to the Youtube site.

This app saves time as all the results are displayed on the single web page rather than the user going to other sites to fetch the
information.

Technology

"Lookitup" uses AJAX calls to request and load data asynchronously from public APIs in response to user click events detected by event-handlers. Using jQuery DOM taversal and manipulation, the data is displayed in an organized layout that has been made responsive and mobile-first by CSS media-queries, allowing the page to be usable and equally optimized on devices with small and large screens alike.
